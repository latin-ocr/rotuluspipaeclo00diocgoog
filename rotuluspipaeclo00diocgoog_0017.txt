to attend the manor court: this was called “ suit.” Some of
the above demands of the lord were onerous enough3 but being

they were much less oppressiva than the exactione prevalent
among the native race. However, the Irish recovering a great
part of their land in the 14th and leth centurias, extended their
own customs and exactions3 and they were imitated by the lords
of English descent, who were therefore said to have become
degenerare. Some of them may have been driven to it, for obtain·

the southern parts fell into anarchy. Its commencement appears
in the roll. From this time feudal rights and dues were super-
seded by more oppressive exactions, borrowed from the Irish
customs3 and many familias of large estates who had held them
under superior lords, by the honourable tenure of chivalry or
knights’ service, were at last reduced to the most miserable con·
dition under the new system. Sir Henry Sidney writing so lately
as 1575, says, “There cameto me also many of the ruined relics
of the ancient English inhabitants of this province, (Munster) as
the Arundels, Rochforts, Barretts, Flemings, Lombards, Terries,
and many others whose ancestors were able, arrd did live like
gentlemen, and knights some of them, and now all in misery,
either banished from their own, or oppressed upon their own.'’

It migh be supposed that the great lords themselves (whom sir
Henry elsewhere calls “ tyrannous potentates’') were in a state cf
freedom, but it was not so. He enumeratas the greatest noblemen
of the county of Cork and the chief men of bot races, and says,
they were the greatest “ possessioners” in that county,·end “ are,
