feeling which rose to the reatest height in France in the most
civilized reign of Louis X , when royalty became, as it were, an
object of worship ; a state of things not very dissimilar from that
which prevailed among the early barbariam, when the prowess of
the chief was the pride of the clan, notwithstanding the tyranny
and oppression which the chiefs exercised. This effect under the
feudal system was not confined to those who held by military
tenure. The habit extended it farther. Even civil services ofa ,
menial kind came to be regarded as honourable. One of our royal
familias took its name from its office of steward to the Crown of
Scotland, audone of the greatest familias in Ireland from its office
of bntler3 and another family of Butler, of baronial rank in
England, took its name from the same office held (not under the
Orown) but under the family of Bellomont earls of Leicester,
while the lords Willoughby of Parham held their lands of the
bisho of Durham by the service of one knight’s fea, and of being
bailiflpand steward to him and his successors, and carrying the
messes of meat to the table on the day of their consecration, and
also at christmas and whitsuntide. As the feudal system died
away, it became usual for great men to hire services, whether for
the purposes of peace or war; the servant, as he was called, being
bound by indenturc to perform them. He was often a man of
very high rank and ancient family; yet, to a late period, no
disparagement seems to have been attached to him. ln arhyming
Playfn'r's history of the eminent Devonshire family of Oarew, composed by

{33¹3ssss one of its members, is the following :-

P·⁶⁰⁷· “The sire not valuing at due price
His wealth, it throws away
Tha son by amaa, or by match
Repaireth the decay.’'

This custom of serving under the compulsion of an indenture
continues to the present da in the case of minora learning a trade.

The condition of the early Irish and Scotch seems to have been
aspecies of feudal system in its infancy. The chieftains in Ireland

might repeatedly displace their tenants and make new dispositione
of the land, whie in ancient Germany‚ supposed to be the cradle

of the feudal system, the title of the occupier continued only from
year to year. But under the matured system introduced into
England by William the Conquerar, and into Ireland by Henry II.,
it was usual to grant land in perpetuity, subject, however, toa
return in the form of military service, or the payment of money in
lieu of it, called cocceam and also to the other incidenta of the
tenure, framegaseclty, aida, reliafa, primer satin, wardahip, (or the
enjoyment of the profits of thc land during the owncr’s minority·,
