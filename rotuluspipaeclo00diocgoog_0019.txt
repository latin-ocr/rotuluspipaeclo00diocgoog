Here the roll was discontinued, probably in consequence of the
utter impossibility of stemming the tide of outrage, or enforcing
any longer the rights of the aee according tolaw.

It appears from the roll that villeinage, cf which so little truce
can be found elsewhere in Irish documents, was anciently quite
prevalent 3 and it further appears that men of Irish race, living on
the bishop's estates, were destitute of any rights in their own
labour, and were in a state of mere slavery, being seemingly ina
similar condition with that class in England who were called
siliciae in prosa. In the year 1348 there occurs, as the render

in the same finding that this John Lowis had thirteen tenanted
houses and some land.

For some of the above, aud many other illustrations of the
ancient state of society, the roll is well worthy of a cureful
examination.

It will be observed that defective sentences, as well as incorrect
latinity‚ sometimes occur; arising, perhaps, from careless attempta
tc abrid ethe documenta. It has not, however, been considered
justifiable to alter the language of the original. A variety also
occurs in the spelling cf man of the names of persons and places.
