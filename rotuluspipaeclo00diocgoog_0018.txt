The extortions seem not ιο have been limited even by Irish J

custom. The family oi Sarsfield held from about the time of
Edward I. to the revolution, a large estate in the county of Corin,
which probably comprised the whole parish oi Templeusque, as .
feudatories of the Barrys3 yet in the reign of Elisabeth the estate
had comato be subjected permanently to en annual exaction of ,
three parts of the produce, a demand which was understood by
'them to be illegal‚ yet not the less compulsory and unavoidable;
usare for in several leaaes which the then granted of parts of the land,
”mmm they provided, that if Lord darry’s claim to the three parts of
the produce should ever be disallowed, the tenants thenceforward
should pay the same to themselves. It does not appear into how
many parts the produce was supposed to be divided, or what

as being a lewd aad tartareus custom.
The time when lawlessness began ιο prevail in the county of
Oorlr ie rather distinctly indicated by the nature of some of the
entries of the roll. At first all transactione between the bishops
aud their feudal and other tenants proceed regularly according ιο·
the English law without disturbance from an aggressor. At
last, in 3402, appears a deed by which Loriir Barry formally
agrees with the bishop ofUCloyne to impose po illegal burthens

which others were obliged ιο submit to. In the same year Maurice
Roche, lord of Fermoy, binde himself in like manner to the bishop
aud ecclesiastics; and in case of infractior agrees to submitto ex-
communication without any legal process. In the third year of
Heury IV. appears a document by which the Earl of Ormond‚ as
lord of half the baron of Inchequin, and farmer of the other half,
