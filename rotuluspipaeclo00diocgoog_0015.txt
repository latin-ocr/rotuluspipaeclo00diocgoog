seems to have continued as it originally stood, except in so far as
it has been affected by special legislation. In Ireland, a tenure
ἐπ capita was never essential to a lsy barony ; and probably the
biebops and abbots themselves were, in general, undertenants. It
appears from some documente near the end of the roll, that the
bispops οξ Ofloyple held large estates as fendatonee of the Barry '.

The tenure by barony was a military tenure of lande of large
extent, containing at least a certain number of knights’ fees, each
of which in England, on an average, consisted of about 680 acres,

and obli ed its possessor to attend the king in war for forty days
when called on. If the holder of any land under military tenure,
whether held by barony or not, granted it for ever to another
person, this did not place the latter inhia lace exactly, as it now
would, but made him an undertenant to epere'on granting, and

their lande by bishops and abbots, aa well as by laymen, though
they were excused from performing it in person.

This roll relatae, not to the government ol the diocese, but to
the possessione of the see. To understand it, itis necessary
to bs acquainted with some of the,incidente of milit tenure.
Every holder was obliged to take an oath of feslty to his ord, and
aleo to do him homage by kneeling and acknowledging himself to
be his “ man.’' But the military nature of the service to be per·
formed, counteracted the humiliating tendency of these forrne,
even when due to follow-sub‘ecte. The pureuit of war and
bloodshed hae, in all ages and countriee, been accounted most
hononrable. Even at the present day itis adopted aa a profession
hythe greatest nobles and princes, notwithstanding the subordi-
nation which discipline requires, and which, to all but those of
high military command, rendere tho profession far more like a
state of slarery than any other condition in this kingdom.

On the foregoing account, then, homages and fealty were re-
garded with no repugnance. The kings of Scotland did homage
to those of Englsnd for certain territorias, and at one time even
for their whole realm. The kings of England did homage to those
of France in like manner. Such examplee would remove all
scruplee of pride between subject and subject. 'l'he moral effect
naturally resulting from these humble exhibitione, was a peculias
reverence for superiority of rank. The greatnees and glory of the
lord were enjoyed by hie vassals as if thoy were their own. 'l'ho
